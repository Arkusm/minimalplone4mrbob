# minimalplone4mrbob
This is a minimal buildout configuration for installing the latest dexterity based Plone 4 and bobtemplates.kitconcept. This buildout uses mr.developer to manage package development. You can use it to create and test addons (third party products) for the latest plone 4 version

## Prerequisites

- Python Python 2.7
- Python virtualenv
- Git

## Install
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:mschmidt42/minimalplone4mrbob.git
$ cd minimalplone4mrbob
$ virtualenv .  # Make sure, it's installing Python 2.7
$ ./bin/pip install -r https://dist.plone.org/release/4-latest/requirements.txt
$ ./bin/buildout
 ```

## Start
```bash
$ ./bin/instance start
 ```
 
 - Or for debugging
```bash
$ ./bin/instance fg
 ```
 
 - Point your webbrowser to http://localhost:6080 (username admin, password
  admin) and install a Plone instance.

## Creating a addon package in src

In the example, the package is called my.package and is located on the filesystem.

```bash
$ ./bin/instance stop
$ cd src
$ ../bin/mrbob -O my.package bobtemplates:plone_addon
 ```
- Choose 'Basic' and answer the questions.

Now you can customize your addon in minimalplone4mrbob/src/my.package

## Including the package

To use the addon it must be included.

```bash
$ cd ..
$ vi dev.cfg  # For editing you can also use another editor than vi
```
```bash
[buildout]
extends = buildout.cfg

auto-checkout +=
    my.package

test-eggs +=
    my.package [test]

[instance]
eggs +=
    my.package

[sources]
my.package = fs my.package path=src
```

```bash
$ ./bin/buildout -c dev.cfg
```


## Quick-installing the product

Start Plone again

```bash
$ ./bin/instance start
 ```

Back in the Plone configuration (or Plone control panel), when you visit the “Add/Remove Products” interface or the portal_quickinstaller tool through the ZMI (at the root of the site), you can see the product show up under the category of “installable products”.

Select and click the button to install the product. If everything goes fine, the product should be installed, and you’re ready to start using it!
